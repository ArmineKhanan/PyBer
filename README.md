# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

PyBer is a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion. As a data analyst we are assigned to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize.

## Results
To complete the assignement I wrote Python scripts using Pandas libraries, the Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib. 
### Summary Statististics
As one can observe from the table below the evrwhelming majority of rides take place in urban areas. Due to this fact, rides in urban areas contribute largely (over 62%) to the total fare amount. Though, another interesting finding is the fact that per rider fare in the rural areas is the biggest: 3 times bigger than in urban areas.
