# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

PyBer is a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion. As a data analyst, I am assigned to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize.

## Results
To complete the assignment I wrote Python scripts using Pandas libraries, the Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib. 
### Summary Statistics
As one can observe from the table below the overwhelming majority of rides take place in urban areas. Due to this fact, rides in urban areas contribute largely (over 62%) to the total fare amount. Though, another interesting finding is the fact that per rider fare in the rural areas is the biggest: 3 times bigger than in urban areas.

### Fare Amount Over the Time
If we look at the weekly fare amount line chart below, we can grasp a hardly noticeable trend of growth of fare amount over time. This, hypothetically, might be attributed to the seasonality nature of the business, and one can expect higher figures for the summer months.

### Summary:

The data proves that the average fare per rider is much higher in suburban and rural areas. Thus it's worth directing marketing efforts there.
Judging from the ratio of rides and riders, it seems there are a lot of 'one-timers' among the customers. Thus it's worth reviewing the retention strategy of the company.

#### Next Steps

To reveal more about the riding patterns of the customers I would like to look at the weekday distribution of customer rides. It would also assist to define the riding purpose: is it a random recreational activity or done for business, e.g. commuting to work?
